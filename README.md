# Gems of war 

Gems of war is a match 3 game that pretty is exactly what I was looking for.
Since it doesn't use energy or any dumb system like that, you can play as much as you like.
Since I already had the code to solve match 3 boards, I decided to try and make a program that could play the game for me to harvest in game resources.

## Treasure hunt

This is the game mode I decided to automate first, since this awards you with gems (in game currency).
The treasure_hunt.exe is ran in the console next to an open instance of Gems Of War.
This will detect the game state, and automatically start matching gems together.
To stop the program, press control+q, it is very hard to close the program using the mouse since the program is actively using this.
